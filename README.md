# flight-delay-prediction-using-classification
In this project I used a dataset of 2000 incidents of flight delays. <br/> With the help of Numpy and Pandas libraries of Python language , I used classification algorithm to predict flight delays based on different factors listed in the dataset. <br/> Finally the program creates the decision tree of the project.
